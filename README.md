# Flutter Stopwatch App
Flutter build of a [stopwatch app](https://dribbble.com/shots/22286609--30-Mobile-App-Concept) designed by [Matt Wojtas](https://dribbble.com/mattwojtas)

This will be the first build out for my new channel [Frozen Solid Designs](https://www.youtube.com/@frozensoliddesigns)

### Fonts
I don't know the legality of pushing font files to GitHub, so I'll leave the actual font files out of this repo. Instead, I've included a fonts folder with placeholders for the font files needed. Be sure to add your own copy of the fonts used in the design before running this project. You can download them from [here: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit)
