# Flutter Stopwatch App
Flutter build of a [stopwatch app](https://dribbble.com/shots/22286609--30-Mobile-App-Concept) designed by [Matt Wojtas](https://dribbble.com/mattwojtas)
---
This will be the first build out for my new channel [Frozen Solid Designs](https://www.youtube.com/@frozensoliddesigns)

### Goal
My goal here is to become better at the Flutter language, and to help other people learn in that process. Additionally, getting some of these designers work out there is a huge bonus, these people do amazing work that I could never do. I plan on showcasing these designs and the designers themselves as well as any useful or interesting tools I come across in the process.

### Design
This design is from [Matt Wojtas](https://dribbble.com/mattwojtas): [Dribble Concept](https://dribbble.com/shots/22286609--30-Mobile-App-Concept)

### Fonts
We're using Google Fonts for this project, but I don't know the legality of pushing font files to GitHub, so I'll leave the actual font files out of this repo. Instead, I've included a fonts folder with placeholders for the font files needed. Be sure to add your own copy of the fonts used in the design before running this project. You can download them from [here: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit)

### Additional Tools
To generate some one of the assets, I came across this tool that we'll be using: [Haikei Generators](https://haikei.app/generators/) - this ended up being exactly what we needed for this project

To generate some random user data, we'll be using [randomuser.me](https://randomuser.me/) - a free API for generating random user data. I've used this tool in the past for my web development work and it's great for mock data.
